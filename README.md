# Harmony-RAT
A simple RAT written in Python that uses Discord as it's C2 server.  


**Features**  
- Full Shell  
- Download files  
- Upload files  
- Screenshot    
- Dump credentials stored in Chrome  
- Persistence  
- And more...


# Usage  
**In your server you MUST create a text channel named 'check-in'  
and create a webhook that posts in the 'check-in' channel**

**You have to enter your Discord servers:**  
* Webhook URL
* Bot Token  
* ServerID  
* executable filename

**Into the script around line 32.**

**If you want an EXE use PyInstaller with harmony.py**  
___
Once harmony is executed it will create a new category on your server named with the hardware ID of the computer that executed it.  


3 channels will also be created in that category:  
&emsp;-main: Use this channel to send commands to the victim computer.  
&emsp;-info: On first run the script will dump useful system information in here.  
&emsp;-creds: On first run the script will dump URL, username and password saved in chrome into here.  

# Commands  

**Commands are used in the main channel in the target category**

To send shell commands prefix the command with '>'.  
&emsp;EX:  
```
> tasklist
# Execute command 'tasklist' and return list of running tasks.

> dir c:\Users\bob\Downloads
# Execute command 'dir c:\Users\bob\Downloads' and return list of files in bobs download directory.
